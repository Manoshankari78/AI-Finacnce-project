# AI-Powered Personal Financial Advisor Prototype

**Review 1 â€“ Academic AI/ML Project**  
_Addressing Gaps in Goal-Oriented Planning and Explainable AI (XAI)_

---

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates a modular, explainable, and goal-oriented AI-powered financial advisor. It is designed for academic purposes to address two key research gaps in current robo-advisory systems:

- **Holistic, goal-based planning** (not just investments)
- **Explainability (XAI)** for user trust

**Key Features:**

- Personalized goal management with dynamic, heuristic planning
- Natural-language explanations for every recommendation
- Modular codebase for easy extension

## Literature Survey Summary

| System Type                | Examples                    | What They Do Well                | Limitations                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| First-Gen Robo-Advisors    | Betterment, Wealthfront     | Automate MPT, risk-based invest. | Static, investment-only, siloed   |
| AI-Enhanced Budgeting Apps | Copilot, Plum, Cleo         | ML for insights, categorization  | Reactive, no forward planning     |
| Emerging AI Platforms      | Bloom (MoneyLion), chatbots | NLP, basic personalization       | Black-box, immature, not adaptive |

**Conclusion:**

> There is a gap for systems that are both _goal-oriented/adaptive_ and _explainable_.

## Research Gaps Addressed

- **Holistic, Goal-Oriented Planning:**  
  Dynamic allocation across multiple, real-life goals (not just investments).

- **Explainability (XAI):**  
  Natural-language explanations for every recommendation, increasing user trust.

**Other Gaps (not implemented):**

- Handling real-life complexity (tax, insurance, etc.)
- Proactive behavioral coaching
- Siloed data views
